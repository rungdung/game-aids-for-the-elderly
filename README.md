## What questions do I think should guide our empathy when we think of the elderly and impaired?

## Possibilities 
To envision a series of explorations into ML based aids for game accessibility. Along the **lines of physical, visual and audio aids.** 
- Envisioning **it as a Social Media with an analogue interface for the digitally illiterate**. 
- Understanding and designing inclusively for multiple, entrenched disabilities. 

### Immediate possibilities 
- Developing proof of concept prototypes for voice and visual aids. Think voice commands, pose recognition natural language processing, etc.

## Goals that need more time:
The ML model trained is an image recognition model and not an object
recognition model. This fundamentally introduces issues. I will need to train an object detection model and then use it on the sketch.
